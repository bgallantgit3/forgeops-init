# FEC Portal Configuration for IDM

This folder contains the copied FEC Portal configuration from IDM-400 revB course.

Note that the following two files are backup from the FEC Portal and not normally found in the this top-level folder:

* `authentication.json` -- this was a backup file before enabling delegated authentication to AM. You can use this file to disable authentication to AM.

* `boot.properties` -- this was a backup from the `resolver/` folder so you can migrate it to 6.5 for DevOps.

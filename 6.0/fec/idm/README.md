# FEC Portal Configuration for IDM

This folder contains the copied FEC Portal configuration from IDM-400 revB course.

Note that the following file is from the FEC Portal and not normally found in the this top-level folder:

* `boot.properties` -- this was a backup from the `resolver/` folder so you can migrate it to 6.5 for DevOps.

Also, the `audit` and `data` folders were copied from the IDM working location so you can copy them more easily.

* `audit` contains a backup of the audit data from the IDM working location, which was `/opt/projects/storage/subscribers`.

* `data` contains the data files (CSV files for the CSV connector). Also originally in `/opt/projects/storage/subscribers`.

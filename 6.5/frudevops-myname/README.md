### Configurations for the FR-523 course
Below are the configurations specifically for the FEC Portal use case.
No guarantees at all as to the state of these configurations.

The goal is to capture the configurations for DS, Amster, AM, IDM, and IG that work with the FEC Portal use case from the IDM-400 _Identity Management Core Concepts_ course.

The FR-523 course uses the FEC Portal use case from the core concepts and migrates the configuration and data to instances running on a Kubernetes cluster.
